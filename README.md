# unit_1_data_visualization
This unit focuses on data visualization in R. 

Once you initialize a project in your Rstudio from this repository (repo), please note the following about the files here.

unit_1_data_vis_blank.Rmd is the file we will use for class.

unit_1_data_vis_complete.Rmd is a filled out version of the blank demo. This is in case you miss anything. Don't use this for class.

The csv files are the data we are using and you don't need to worry about them for now.
